Lucky Ducks adds sets of cute lil rubber ducks that you can purchase from the wandering trader. Currently, they can be used as decoration. They can be picked up and worn, which will make you play a squeaky sound when you take damage.


Planned features include:
- Inflating the duck to make it bigger, and rideable.
- Structure to rarely find ducks.



The current sets of rubber ducks include:
- Dye Colors
- Pride Ducks
